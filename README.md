These codes were written for a paper 'Companion Diagnosis of Depression: Detection and Response Prediction using EVs-SERS-XAI'.
* Unauthorized use of this code for other purpose is prohibited.

This repository contains Python codes to show example of depression detection and treatment response prediction using SERS spectra of EV from plasma.

Unauthorized commercial use of the models and source data is rigorously prohibited.
For the weight values used in these models, commercial use through transfer learning or modulation beyond the scope of the license is prohibited. 

Again, the unauthorized or commercial use is prohibited. For non-commercial purposes or use of the database for research, please contact the author of the paper.
